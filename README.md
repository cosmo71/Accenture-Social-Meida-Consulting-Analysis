## Recomendations 
<if posts are decreasing for some month then try to incentivze people to post>
IDK what to recommend because the task at hand is to get find insights about the social media platform 

## Clarrifying Questtions, Assumptions, and Caveats 
Definetly mention that the data in both of the June's was incomplete because half of the month was missing due to this we could not find trends between quaters as they included june and had to remove june from trend analysis as well.
